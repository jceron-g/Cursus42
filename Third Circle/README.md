# Third Circle - 42 Projects

Welcome to the **Third Circle** of 42 projects! This directory contains advanced-level projects that focus on **systems programming, process synchronization, concurrency, and shell implementation**. These projects require a deep understanding of low-level programming and system interactions.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

### **Minishell** - Building a Simple Shell
**Minishell** is a project that involves recreating a simplified version of the Unix shell. The goal is to understand how a shell interprets commands, manages processes, and interacts with the operating system. Key learning aspects include:
- Parsing and executing shell commands.
- Managing multiple processes using `fork()`, `execve()`, and `waitpid()`.
- Handling signals and user input.
- Implementing redirections and pipes.

This project provides an in-depth look at how terminal-based shells work and prepares for more complex system programming tasks.

### **Philosophers** - Concurrency and Synchronization
**Philosophers** is a project based on the classic **Dining Philosophers Problem**, which is used to illustrate issues related to concurrent programming. The goal is to manage multiple threads representing philosophers who alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping while avoiding **deadlocks** and **race conditions**. Key concepts covered include:
- Multithreading with `pthread_create()` and `pthread_join()`.
- Synchronization using **mutexes** (`pthread_mutex_lock()` and `pthread_mutex_unlock()`).
- Preventing deadlocks and starvation using proper resource management.

This project is an essential introduction to **concurrent programming** and prepares for real-world applications involving parallel execution.

## üîç Key Learning Objectives
- **Process and thread management**: Understanding process creation, execution, and communication.
- **Concurrency control**: Implementing multithreading and avoiding race conditions.
- **System calls and signals**: Working with system-level functions and inter-process communication.

These projects are among the most challenging in the 42 curriculum but provide critical knowledge for system programming and software engineering.

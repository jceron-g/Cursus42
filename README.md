# 42 Projects Repository

Welcome to my **42 Projects Repository**! This repository contains the projects I have developed as part of the **42 curriculum**, covering a wide range of topics including **C programming, algorithms, data structures, system programming, and more**.

## 📌 About 42
[42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) is a highly regarded coding school that emphasizes peer learning, hands-on projects, and problem-solving skills. The curriculum is structured to help students develop expertise in low-level programming, algorithms, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software engineering.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized into different circles, each representing a stage in the 42 curriculum:

```
📁 42-projects-repo
│── 📁 First_Circle
│   │── 📁 libft
│   │── 📁 ft_printf
│   │── 📁 get_next_line
│
│── 📁 Second_Circle
│   │── 📁 push_swap
│   │── 📁 pipex
│   │── 📁 fract-ol
│
│── 📁 Third_Circle
│   │── 📁 minishell
│   │── 📁 philosophers
```

Each project has its own directory containing:
- **Source code (`src/`)**
- **Header files (`includes/`)**
- **Makefile** for compilation (if applicable)
- **README.md** with project-specific details

## 🚀 Projects
Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

### First Circle
- **Libft**: Implementation of a custom C library with useful functions.
- **ft_printf**: Recreation of the `printf` function in C.
- **Get_Next_Line**: Efficient function to read a file line by line.

### Second Circle
- **Push_Swap**: Sorting algorithm challenge using two stacks.
- **Pipex**: A project that mimics Unix pipelines to execute chained commands.
- **Fract-ol**: A computer graphics project using **MiniLibX** to render fractals, including the **Mandelbrot** and **Julia** sets. The program allows zooming (via keyboard controls), parameter customization, and smooth window management.

### Third Circle
- **Minishell**: A simple shell interpreter inspired by Bash.
- **Philosophers**: A concurrency problem simulation using threads and mutexes.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Language**: C
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Libraries**: Standard C Library, POSIX functions

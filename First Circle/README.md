# First Circle - 42 Projects

Welcome to the **First Circle** of 42 projects! This directory contains foundational projects that focus on mastering C programming, memory management, and fundamental algorithmic techniques. These projects lay the groundwork for more advanced topics in later stages of the curriculum.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

### **Libft** - The Custom C Library
**Libft** is the first major project at 42. It involves implementing a collection of essential C standard library functions, as well as additional utility functions to aid in future projects. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of memory management, string manipulation, linked lists, and other fundamental data structures. This library serves as a toolkit that will be reused in many upcoming projects.

### **ft_printf** - Recreating printf
This project consists of implementing a simplified version of the `printf` function from the standard C library. It covers:
- Handling various format specifiers (`%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%x`, etc.).
- Implementing variable argument lists using `va_list`.
- Managing formatted output efficiently without using external libraries.

This project strengthens understanding of **variadic functions**, **buffer management**, and **formatted output processing**.

### **Get Next Line (GNL)** - Reading from a File Descriptor
**Get Next Line** is a function that reads and returns one line at a time from a file descriptor. Unlike standard file-reading functions, GNL allows for efficient line-by-line reading without loading an entire file into memory. Key aspects covered in this project include:
- Dynamic memory allocation.
- Efficient file handling using **buffers**.
- Proper memory management to avoid leaks and ensure optimal performance.

This project is essential for later work with file parsing and input handling in more complex applications.

## üîç Key Learning Objectives
- **Memory management**: Deep understanding of `malloc`, `free`, and proper buffer handling.
- **Algorithmic thinking**: Implementing efficient and optimized solutions.
- **Variadic functions**: Using `va_list` to handle multiple arguments.
- **File handling**: Managing file descriptors and dynamic input parsing.

These projects are crucial stepping stones that will be useful in many future challenges within the 42 curriculum.

# Second Circle - 42 Projects

Welcome to the **Second Circle** of 42 projects! This directory contains intermediate-level projects that build upon the foundational skills from the First Circle. These projects introduce **algorithmic problem-solving, process handling, inter-process communication, and graphical programming**.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

### **Push Swap** - Sorting Algorithm Challenge
**Push Swap** is a project focused on implementing an efficient sorting algorithm using only two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a limited set of operations. The objective is to sort a list of numbers using the minimum number of moves. Key learning aspects include:
- Implementing and optimizing sorting algorithms.
- Understanding time complexity and efficient operations.
- Managing stack-based data structures.

### **Pipex** - Unix Pipelines Implementation
**Pipex** replicates the behavior of Unix pipelines (`|` operator in the shell), allowing the execution of chained commands with redirected input and output. This project enhances knowledge in:
- File descriptor manipulation.
- Process creation using `fork()`.
- Data redirection with `dup2()`.
- Executing system commands with `execve()`.

This project is crucial for understanding how Unix shells work under the hood.

### **Fract-ol** - Fractal Rendering with MiniLibX
**Fract-ol** is a computer graphics project that uses the **MiniLibX** library to generate and display fractals, including **Mandelbrot** and **Julia** sets. It explores:
- Complex number calculations for fractal generation.
- Graphical rendering using pixel manipulation.
- Handling user inputs (keyboard/mouse) for interaction.

The project provides a great introduction to computer graphics and optimization techniques.

## üîç Key Learning Objectives
- **Algorithm optimization**: Implementing sorting algorithms efficiently.
- **Process control**: Understanding `fork()`, `execve()`, and inter-process communication.
- **File and input/output management**: Redirecting input and output using system calls.
- **Computer graphics**: Rendering visuals using mathematical computations.

These projects provide essential skills that will be valuable in future system programming and software development challenges.
